# NebulaBot Commands

This folder contains the command files for the NebulaBot project. Each file 
defines a specific command that the bot can execute. The commands are 
implemented in TypeScript and are designed to handle various tasks and 
interactions within the bot's functionality.

The `src/commands` directory is structured to keep the command logic 
organized and maintainable. Each command file follows a consistent format 
to ensure ease of development and debugging.
